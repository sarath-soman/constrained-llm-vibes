# LLM Enterprise Research

This folder contains research and insights on using Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively in complex enterprise codebases, based on real-world experiences and practical frameworks.

## Key Problem Statement

There's a significant gap between developers who struggle with LLMs on complex enterprise codebases and those who report transformative productivity gains. This research explores why this gap exists and provides actionable frameworks to bridge it.

## Core Insight

> "Don't make LLMs understand your codebase. Make your codebase impossible for LLMs to misunderstand."

The most successful approach isn't about better prompts or smarter models - it's about creating constrained environments where LLMs can only produce correct code.

## Research Sections

### [01-core-insights/](./01-core-insights/)
- The fundamental tension between LLM assistance and developer agency
- The "psychological ownership" problem
- Why LLMs fail on complex enterprise codebases
- The architect's paradigm shift: amplification vs replacement

### [02-practical-framework/](./02-practical-framework/)
- Three-phase implementation approach
- Executable architectural rules
- Safe zones for LLM operation
- Validation strategies and litmus tests

### [03-dsl-validation/](./03-dsl-validation/)
- Mini Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) design
- AST predicate systems
- Three-layer validation architecture
- Concrete implementation examples

### [04-examples/](./04-examples/)
- Real-world code patterns and transformations
- Tool implementations (doing-it-wrong.ts style)
- Sample DSL definitions
- Validation rule examples

## Key Outcomes

When implemented correctly, this approach enables:
- LLMs to handle tedious implementation while humans maintain architectural control
- Developers to remain "programmers" rather than becoming "prompters"
- Safe refactoring and code generation at enterprise scale
- Continuous evolution of tooling alongside codebase growth

## Next Steps

1. Audit existing codebase for repeated patterns
2. Implement validation rules for current architecture
3. Create safe transformation zones
4. Build specialized agents for narrow domains
5. Evolve tooling based on learnings
