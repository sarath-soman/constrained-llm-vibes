## 🎯 Detailed Analysis

### 🥇 **Prolog - The Logic Champion**

**Why it wins:**
- **Perfect domain match**: Constraint satisfaction is exactly what Prolog does
- **Ultimate expressiveness**: Constraints as logical facts and rules
- **Token efficiency**: 40 tokens vs 150 for TypeScript (70% savings)
- **Natural querying**: `?- valid_plugin(MyClass)` reads like English

**Implementation preview:**
```prolog
% Define constraint rules as facts
plugin_rule(Class) :-
    extends_class(Class, 'BaseActionPlugin'),
    has_decorator(Class, 'Injectable'),
    defines_property(Class, metadata).

% Query violations naturally
find_violations(Class, Violations) :-
    \+ plugin_rule(Class),
    Violations = ['architectural-violation'].
```

**Why not first in practice:**
- **LLM training gap**: Limited Prolog in training data
- **Ecosystem**: Fewer parsing libraries for modern languages
- **Team adoption**: Steep learning curve for most developers

### 🥈 **ReScript - The Practical Winner**

**Why it's the sweet spot:**
- **Excellent token efficiency**: 55 tokens (65% savings vs TypeScript)
- **LLM friendly**: JavaScript-like syntax with OCaml power
- **Modern tooling**: Great VS Code support, active development
- **JS ecosystem**: Compiles to clean JavaScript, npm compatible
- **Type safety**: Full OCaml type system catches LLM errors

**Implementation preview:**
```rescript
let mustExtend = (baseClass, content) =>
  if !containsInheritance(content, baseClass) {
    [{ruleId: "must-extend", severity: Error, 
      message: `Must extend ${baseClass}`}]
  } else {
    []
  }

let pluginRules = content =>
  mustExtend("BaseActionPlugin", content)
  ->Belt.Array.concat(mustHaveDecorator("Injectable", content))
  ->Belt.Array.concat(mustDefineProperty("metadata", content))
```

**Production advantages:**
- **Deploy anywhere**: npm package, Node.js, browsers
- **Team maintainable**: JavaScript devs can contribute
- **Cost effective**: Significant token savings + fast development

### 🥉 **Crystal - The Ruby Evolution**

**Why it's compelling:**
- **Ruby expressiveness**: Familiar syntax with macros and DSLs
- **Performance**: Compiled to native code, fast execution
- **Type safety**: Static typing catches errors at compile time
- **Token efficiency**: 80 tokens (45% savings vs TypeScript)

**Implementation preview:**
```crystal
macro constraint_rule(name, &block)
  def validate_{{name.id}}(content : String) : Array(Violation)
    {{block.body}}
  end
end

constraint_rule "plugin_architecture" do
  must_extend(content, "BaseActionPlugin") +
  must_have_decorator(content, "Injectable") +
  must_define_property(content, "metadata")
end
```

**Best for:**
- **Ruby teams** wanting compile-time safety + performance
- **Gradual migration** from Ruby constraint systems
- **Performance-critical** constraint validation
